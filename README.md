# Angular.js wrapper starter project

This starter project aims to wrap the angular.js library in an Angular2+ development workflow and syntax using typescript, decorators, and a bundled output using minimal dependencies.  

As stated, a goal of this project is to keep the dependencies to a minimum and provide a similar development experience to that which is found in new versions of Angular and Angular CLI.  

This project currently provides:
* A simple native Node.js development server.
* A simple html template loader/packager.
* The angular.js 1.7.5 distributable framework (dev and prod) with supporting documentation.
* Module, Component, Directive, and Service decorators.
* Transpiled wtih TypeScript to an amd modules bundle and loaded with almond.js.
* Visual Studio Code tasks for quick compiling (Ctrl+Shift+B)
* NPM scripts for quick compiling and starting the development server.

This project is a demo of how to setup and create an angular.js application using a minimal amount of development tooling installations.

Still a work in progress.
